✅ Bootstrap Pattern: 
By moving React imports to bootstrap.jsx and using import() in main.jsx,
you delay module loading until shared modules are initialized.

✅ Enhanced Shared Config:
singleton: true - Only one instance of React/React-DOM across all federated modules
eager: false - Don't load immediately; wait for proper initialization
requiredVersion: false - Allows version flexibility between remotes
strictVersion: false - Won't error on version mismatches
