Root Cause
Your entry point (main.jsx) directly imports React at the top level, but the shared modules haven't finished initializing yet in a Module Federation setup.

Solution: Bootstrap Pattern
You need to restructure your entry points to defer React imports until after shared modules are ready. Here's the fix:


✅ Bootstrap Pattern: 
By moving React imports to bootstrap.jsx and using import() in main.jsx,
you delay module loading until shared modules are initialized.

✅ Enhanced Shared Config:
singleton: true - Only one instance of React/React-DOM across all federated modules
eager: false - Don't load immediately; wait for proper initialization
requiredVersion: false - Allows version flexibility between remotes
strictVersion: false - Won't error on version mismatches
